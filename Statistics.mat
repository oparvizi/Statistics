#% Comparison Between Traditional Statistics and Computational Statistics
#% Traditional Statistics                                Computational Statistics
#% Small to moderate sample size                         Large to very large sample size
#% Independent, identically distributed data sets        Nonhomogeneous data sets
#% One or low dimensional                                High dimensional
#% Manually computational                                Computationally intensive
#% Mathematically tractable                              Numerically tractable
#% Well focused questions                                Imprecise questions
#% Strong unverifiable assumptions:                      Weak or no assumptions:
#%        Relationships (linearity,                      Relationships (nonlinearity)
#%        additivity)                                    Error structures (distribution free)
#% Error structures (normality)
#% Statistical inference                                 Structural inference
#% Predominantly closed form algorithms                  Iterative algorithms possible
#% Statistical optimality                                Statistical robustness

#% Computational Statistics Toolbox:

#% Common Distributions-----------------------------
#% Binomial---------
#% Example: Suppose there is a 20% chance that an adult American suffers from a psychiatric disorder. % We randomly sample 25 adult Americans.
prob = binocdf(3,25,0.2);
prob2 = sum(binopdf(0:3,25,0.2));

#% Get the values for the domain, x.
x = 0:6;
#% Get the values of the probability mass function.
#% First for n = 6, p = 0.3:
pdf1 = binopdf(x,6,0.3);
#% Now for n = 6, p = 0.7:
pdf2 = binopdf(x,6,0.7);
#% Do the plots.
subplot(1,2,1),bar(x,pdf1,1,'w')
title(' n = 6, p = 0.3')
xlabel('X'),ylabel('f(X)')
axis square
subplot(1,2,2),bar(x,pdf2,1,'w')
title(' n = 6, p = 0.7')
xlabel('X'),ylabel('f(X)')
axis square

#% Poisson-----------
#% Example: In preparing this text, we executed the spell check command, and the editor reviewed the manuscript for typographical errors. In spite of this, some
#% mistakes might be present. Assume that the number of typographical errors per page follows the Poisson distribution with parameter We calculate the 
#% probability that a page will have at least two errors as follows:

prob = 1-poisscdf(1,0.25);
